# Calculate-your-age-with-MVVM
Calculate your age is a simple application from a unit screen that contains a button and two text inputs, a unit for the name and a unit for age
Calculate your age is a simple application to calculate the age where you give it the name and the year of miles and the age comes out for you
But with the use of the principles of Solid and some of the libraries of Jet Pack and the addition of everything that can be added as a matter of experimentation, as this is an application that is not complicated, so it is easy to understand these principles
In the future I will try to add some units of measurement and added some otherJetpack libraries
